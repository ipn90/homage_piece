# This is a replication of  Pret A Manger website for a full stack development traning project.

## Project Brief

- This project focuses on gaining skills on Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 


- This project was built to showcase skills aquired within the 8 weeks tranning.

# Description 
*Coffee lovers will visit my replicated  Pret A Manger website to be able to order and their favorite coffee, breakfast, Sweet and savoury snacks, Sandwiches, baguettes and wraps etc.*

- I have gained ample knowlegde on HTML and CSS utilising some concepts like flex, grid CSS and CSS SAAS.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- MediaQuery
- CSS SAAS
- Javascript will be added soon to the project


## Installation
- Install Visual studio code editor - this is used as an intergrtaed develeopment environment (IDE) with lots of extentions and plugijn for web development. 

- Installation of Sass compliler which is a stylesheet language that's compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

- The SCSS syntax uses the file extension .scss. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.

- The indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, and so it uses the file extension .sass. Because of this extension, it’s sometimes just called “Sass”. The indented syntax supports all the same features as SCSS, but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.

*First, launch Visual Studio Code. Once it's loaded, go to the side panel on the left and select the extensions tab. In the search bar, search for "Live Sass Compiler" and install it. This extension helps us to compile the Sass files*
